This repo contains a patched version of the Uniswap Interface for personal usage. 

Credit to https://github.com/kisickilukasz for fixing the `__generated__` folder problem: https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/pull/7637

If you have any problems with this version, create an issue.

I do not intend to keep this up to date with Uniswap/interface.

## Directions
To run the patched web version, open a terminal in `./apps/web/`
Follow the directions here:
https://github.com/mteam88/patched-interface/blob/main/apps/web/README.md:

```

Then open the link that appears in your browser.
